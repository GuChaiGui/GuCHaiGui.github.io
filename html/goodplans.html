            <h3>The National Art Center</h3>
            <p class="locations-info info-nac">
                The restaurant that Taki and Okudera-senpai dined at during their date is called "Salon de thé Rond"
                and is located on the second floor of The National Art Centre.
                To get a better view, I suggest going up to the third floor.
                but I will talk more about it in the <a href="goodplans.html#eat">"3 places to eat"</a></li> section.<br><br>
                I wanted to pay attention to some shots of the Art Center during the date like the brown-lined walls
                and glass-paneled directions. Going inside the facility is <strong>free of charge</strong>.
                You can visit and take picture in the same position as Taki, it could be a good pictures like "Expectation VS Reality".

            <h3>Tokyo City View</h3>
            <p class="locations-info info-tcv">
                Roppongi Hills is a very popular viewing tower in Tokyo,
                showing absolutely stunning views of the Tokyo cityscape,
                it also has the tallest outdoor viewing platform in Tokyo!
                Roppongi Hills is one of the main places that Taki and Okudera-Senpai go on their date,
                as you can see from the top picture! <br><br>
                This place is great as you can take people there who don’t know about “Your Name” and they will still find it amazing.
                It costs at least <strong>¥1,800</strong> to get in, but sometimes you have to sacrifice for your anime journey.<br>
                If you've got time, there's an art gallery (on the same floor) and an art museum (one floor down).

            <h3>Suga Shrine</h3>
            <p class="locations-info info-tcv">
                The spots between Yotsuya Station and Suga Shrine are pretty important for us Your Name fans,
                they're featured during the climax of the film when Taki and Mitsuha are trying to find each other
                (you know, the part where you were crying so hard you could barely see the screen).<br>
                From Yotsuya Station, head toward Yotsuya Sanchōme, walking on the left side of the street, Shinjuku Dōri.
                You'll run into a Lawson 100 convenience store. Take a left from there. You'll see these signs!
                When you're done adoring this spot, go back to Shinjuku Dōri and keep walking the same direction.<br>
                The stairs of Suga Shrine are the absolute culmination of the film.
                The scene is definitely the most impressive and iconic in all of Your Name.
                You probably remember it from the promotional images before you even saw the movie.

                In the movie, Taki went on a date with his crush at the time, Okudera-senpai in Roppongi Hills.
                It's called Salon de Thé Rond, located on the second floor of the National Art Center.
                There's no admission fee to get into the building, so you have free access to this coffee shop.
                You can go up to the third floor a little before then and took some pictures from above.
                From this angle, you got a great shot of the modern, stylish architecture of the museum and the coffee shop.

            <h3>Café la Bohème</h3>
            <p class="locations-info info-tcv">
                Cafe La Boheme is a restaurant that is located in Shinjuku, close to Shinjuku Gyoen.
                If you think it looks familiar, that’s because this is where Taki worked part time at and met Okudera-senpai.
                The vibe of the restaurant is very similar to that in the anime, meaning it is quite a “posh” restaurant but
                the prices are very reasonable! This is a great place to stop at for some lunch or dinner!
                Although the restaurant has a French name, the restaurant has an extensive menu full of dishes
                that are liked by everyone! There are tons of pasta dishes as well as pizza, salads and much more!<br>
                One of our dear readers let us know that the name of the restaurant in the movie,
                Il Giardino delle Parole, means "The Garden of Words" in Italian.
                No need to explain for fans of Shinkai's work but that's the name of his previous movie. Such a neat detail!

                        This hotel is located 5 minutes from <strong>Yunika Vision</strong>. It's a giant television

                        In the film, Yunika Vision is where the fall of the Tiamat comet is broadcast.
                        The area is crowded and busy so be careful when taking photos not to block the pedestrian crossing.<br>
                        I chose this hotel so that you have a view of the Yunika Vision from afar
                        and moreover it's not very expensive and still remains very close to the Yunika Vision.
                        In addition, you can be put in confidence quite quickly by the name of the hotel which is none
                        other than "ibis", a very famous hotel brand.

            <h3>Kamisuwa Onsen Shinyu Hotel</h3>
            <p class="locations-info info-tcv">
                Kamisuwa Onsen Shinyu Hotel is a hotel just in front of the suwa lake,
                indeed if you stay in this hotel you will have the view on the lake.<br>
                Isn't it beautiful? You wake up to a beautiful view, traditional architecture as
                if you were actually in the movie! This hotel is perhaps a bit expensive but
                I wanted to share it with you since despite its price, the traditional architecture really pleased us.
                In addition, there are onsens that are thermal springs! Like in the animes!
                You can finally experience this and everything will be included in your rental! <br>
                The positive side of this hotel too is that you are at Makoto Shinkai's birthplace!
                It's also there that the fall of the comet took place in the film.
                You can tell your friends that you are staying in the same city as Mitsuha Miyamizu!
                And maybe a comet-like shooting star will pass over your head
                (hope you don't have the same misfortune as mitsuha, just kidding). <br>
                The downside being that you are 2h30 from tokyo city...

            <h3>Tokyu Stay Yotsuya</h3>
            <p class="locations-info info-tcv">
                Tokyu Stay Yotsuya is the cheapest hotel of the three that I chose. I chose the one there because it is 5 minutes
                from Yotsuya station. In addition to being very practical to be close to a train station,
                it's notably a place that appears in the movie your name when he has a date with Okudera-sensei.
                You can take expectation vs reality photos with your partner or alone too (kinda sad if so)!
